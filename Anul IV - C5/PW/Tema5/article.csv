1"|"AMD’s K12 custom ARM 64-bit coming in 2016"|"AMD 20nm Skybridge A57 in 2015"|"<p>Seattle is the first AMD ARM based server product and it is on track to ship in the latter half of 2014. In 2015 AMD plans another Cortex A57-based product codenamed Project Skybridge, a 20nm version of the A57-based server chip. AMD is playing it safe as it takes time to launch volume production at a new node.</p><p> Since the Seattle Opteron A1100 series is AMD’s first attempt to make a 64-bit ARM product, the company decided to use the mature 28nm process rather than the much riskier 20nm. In 2015 Project Skybridge will replace Seattle 28nm cores and Project Skybridge brings 20nm silicon. </p>
2"|"Microsoft plans a huge patch Tuesday tomorrow "|"More upgrades than you can poke a stick at"|"<p><strong>Tomorrow’s</strong> Patch Tuesday is the biggest of 2014 with eight bulletins.&nbsp;Two critical patches deal with remote-code execution in Internet Explorer 7 and newer, and SharePoint and Office Online - previously known as Office Web Apps.&nbsp;The remaining six are all labelled "important". Bulletins 3 and 8 address a remote-code execution flaw and a security feature bypass vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2007 and newer.&nbsp;Bulletins 4 to 7 are applicable to Windows Vista and newer and Windows Server 2003 and newer, with 4 to 6 addressing elevation of privilege flaws, while 7 fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.</p><p>This is the biggest batch of updates seen this year so far, but each of the eight bulletins only address a few flaws so it is probably not a big deal.&nbsp;What is interesting about this batch of patches is that this is the first which does not fix any holes for Windows XP, indicating that Microsoft really is sticking to its guns over the death of the aged OS.&nbsp;Some had thought that Redmond would blink and be forced to issue updates for its software meaning that they would be justified in keeping the ancient software going.</p><p>Microsoft issued an out-of-band patch for a different critical IE exploit, including Windows XP in the update - leading to speculation the company may have make a full U-turn on its promise to stop supporting the elderly OS.&nbsp;Since XP is still on a third of the world’s machines it means that any vulnerabilities that are found between now and doomsday will be an open door for hackers.</p>
3"|"Intel 9-series chipset is official "|"Haswell refresh tweaks and more"|"<p><strong>Intel</strong> has officially launched the new Z97 and H97 chipsets, just in time for the Haswell refresh rollout. To be honest, the chipsets were no secret to begin with, as listings of 9-series boards started appearing a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>Intel is not making much of a fuss about <a href="/home/item/34494-intel-lists-haswell-refresh-parts" target="_blank">Haswell refresh</a> and the new 9-series platform. Haswell refresh is basically a clock bump, so there is really not much to talk about. However, the new chipsets bring a few new features to the table.</p><h2><strong>Speedy M.2 storage, SRT tweaks</strong></h2><p>The H97 and Z97 feature support for M.2 storage, which can deliver transfer speeds of up to 1GB/s, at least in theory. SATA Express support is on board, too.</p><p><img src="http://www.fudzilla.com/images/stories/2014/February/intel-9-series-chipset.jpg" alt="intel-9-series-chipset"></p>
